# Learning CSS3 and Animations
==============================

I am planning on creating a landscape using mosly CSS. Within the landscape, I want to present differnt weather scenes. They will all use animations for the weather. This will require some javascript to adjust different classes based on the weather selected. 

### Why I want to do it

1. I would like to become more proficient in css and animations.
2. Work on best practices to improve performance, expecially when there are going to be a lot of animations. 
3. Learn how to make it work across multiple browsers such as, Chrome, Firefox, Edge
4. Increase my workflow using Sass instead of css

#### Technologies being used
* HTML
* JavaScript
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - Task manager
